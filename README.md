### Glad to see you here!  
I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, currently pursuing a Master's in Artificial Intelligence at the esteemed Khoury College of Computer Sciences in Boston. My academic journey is deeply rooted in a passion for AI, and my expected coursework is specifically tailored to the fields that inspire me the most: Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

The fusion of Computer Vision and Deep Learning has always fascinated me. The capability of machines to understand and interpret visual data, mirroring human perception, represents a profound and ever-evolving aspect of AI. During my undergraduate studies, my focus was on enhancing Monocular Depth Estimation techniques by optimizing the encoder architecture. This project provided me with a solid foundation in vision-related concepts such as image segmentation and neural networks. In my current academic and research endeavors, my aim is to delve deeper into these disciplines, refining my expertise and gaining a comprehensive understanding of their applications and potential.

As I progress in my academic pursuits, my aspiration is to contribute meaningfully to the field of AI through impactful research. My chosen path perfectly aligns with this ambition, as I intend to leverage my knowledge and skills to explore the frontiers of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. My goal is to extend the boundaries of what's possible and make substantial contributions to these fields, addressing real-world challenges and unveiling innovative solutions.
